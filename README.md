## Space Photos!

Hello! This is a simple program to retreive astronomy photos from NASA official site. By default, it will start from 2020-01-01 and find several images to download. If you'd like to change the parameters, feel free to edit the log.txt.

SpaceDownload.py would give you the option to input from python shell.

SpaceNoChoice.py would use the log, or create one with default settings.
